## Background and Motivation

- Need to move contents for keeping the history and the contacting point
- Very old hardware
  - Purached in 1999?
  - 34GB SCSI HDD x5

```
% df -g

```

- Make maintainance costs minimize as much as possible
  - Release from hardware maintainance
  - Give it someone but me in other words :-P

## HDD image migration

- Two options;
1. Copy HDD raw image
  - dd if=/dev/daX | ssh somewhere cat &gt; hddimageX.img
  - Simplest way but;
    - Five disk must be mounted on single VM on wcc.wide but it does not support more than one disk currently
    - Need knowledge about HDD image format on wcc.wide
      - VHD, VMDK, qcow or ...?
    - Need to convert the image
2. Clean install latest OS and rsync data
  - OS (FreeBSD) can be upgraded to the latest version (6.4 -&gt; 8.1) in side effect
    - FreeBSD 6.4 will be End of Life in 30/Nov/2010
- I choose the second option

## IP Renumbering

- IPv4 renumbering is so hard because;
  - www.kame.net is the primary DNS server of kame.net and seven secondary DNS servers for other domains
    - Need to ask for NIC to change the address
    - Decided to keep the IPv4 address
    - Announce the /32 host route of the server in WIDE backbone
- The IPv6 address can be renumberd easily
  - Nothing depends on it fortunately (?)

---

## Network

- Use Shima-san's map646
  - <a href="http://github.com/keiichishima/map646">http://github.com/keiichishima/map646</a>
  - IPv4 inbound connections are mapped to IPv6 connections
    - 2001:200:d00:100::/64
  - NAPT is used for outbound connections
  - No intermediate box for IPv6 connections

## The dancing KAME

- All of HTTP connections are IPv6 anymore
- Change perl scripts to check if a prefix match with the translated prefix
- Before:

```
if ($ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} =~ /:/) {
  $v6p = 'yes';
}
```

- After:

```
if ($ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} !~ /2001:200:d00:100::/) {
  $v6p = 'yes';
}
```

---

## Issues

- IPv4 only apps does not work
  - Modify the codes to support IPv6 before the migration
- IPv4 access list does not work
  - SSH bruteforceblocker (ports/security/bruteforceblocker) can share IPv4 list of attackers with other servers but it does not work
- Different global IPv4 addresses are used depending on inboud and outboud connections
  - NAPT box's IPv4 address is used for a outbound connection even though www.kame.net has global IPv4 address
  - Primary DNS servers need to change the ACL of zone trasfer when www.kame.net is secondary DNS server of the zone
- Scalability
  - Is /32 announcement correct way?
  - map646 is designed as stateless
    - Can be scale out (no ftp conversion of corse)
    - No FTP conversion, however

---

## Rests of the migration

- There was no serious problem during the migration
- All of the service did not stop during the renumbering
- WIDE Cloud seems quite stable
  - vm2.fujisawa goes down once but vm3.nezu cod migrate the VM immeadiately
    - Thanks, Sekiya-san
  - We can trust VM storage more than local HDD, can't we?

## Go a head, sh.wide.ad.jp!
