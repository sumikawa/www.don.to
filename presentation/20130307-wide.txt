## Current implementation

- Only file_copy support progree bar
  - copy_vm_image, create_vm, quick_create_vm
- replacement file_copy()
- copy chunk(16MB) and update the status via Websocket
- it's diffict to support ISO uploading with current architecture

```
def copy_file_progressbar(from, to, channel_name)
  size_of_source_file = File.size(from)
  current_size = 0
  read_chunk_size = 16*1024*1024
  File.open(from, "rb") do |fd_r|
    File.open(to, "wb", fd_r.stat.mode) do |fd_w|
      progressbar(channel_name, size_of_source_file) do
        current_size += fd_w.syswrite(fd_r.sysread(read_chunk_size))
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## def progressbar

```
def progressbar(channel_name, total_size, &func)
  prev_percentage = 0
  current_size = 0
  wcc_websocket(channel_name) do |client|
    while current_size < total_size
      current_size = func.call()
      percentage = sprintf("%.1f", 100.0 * current_size / total_size)
      if prev_percentage != percentage
        client.send(percentage.to_s + "\n")
        prev_percentage = percentage
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Update status via WebSocket

- Using action and the id for Channel ID
  - 'copy_vm_100'

## Issues

- <del>file copy stalls if updating server stalls</del>
- Security issues

---
## Security issue

- It's progress bar. We don't need to consider it seriously but;
- No binding mechanism between pre-UPGRADE and post-UPGRADE in server side
  - Client tell the channel
  - Can snoop it after the valid authorisation

## How prevent it?

- pusher.com authenticate private channels by oauth
  - Can spoof my other sessions but seems enough secure in realistic point of view
  - It seems too much for wcc
- Randomize channel ID cod be good solution for wcc
